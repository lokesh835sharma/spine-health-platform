## 🤖 ML Pipeline

```
User Input (14 Qs)
       ↓
Preprocessing
  ├── Age & Sitting Hours → StandardScaler (ss_seated.pkl)
  ├── Gender → OHE (drop first) → StandardScaler (ss_ohe.pkl)
  └── 10 Categorical → OrdinalEncoder (oe.pkl) → StandardScaler (ss_oe.pkl)
       ↓
Feature Vector [12D: seated, gender_ohe, 10 OE cols]
       ↓
PCA (pca.pkl) → [2D: PC1, PC2]
  PC1 = Pain axis (stiffness, pain, family history)
  PC2 = Lifestyle axis (sitting, OTT, activity)
       ↓
K-Means (kmeans.pkl, k=4)
  Cluster 0 → High Risk
  Cluster 1 → Very High Risk
  Cluster 2 → Low Risk
  Cluster 3 → Moderate Risk
       ↓
Risk Report + 6 Personalized Recommendations
